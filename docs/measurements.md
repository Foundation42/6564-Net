# sim6564 Measurement Record

Go/no-go data for the MAC & chains sketch (§6 of docs/6564-mac-and-chains-sketch.md).
Regenerate with `sim6564 measure`; append a dated section per feature landing.

## MAC mechanism landed (2026-07-16)

Mechanism implemented ($?F column, per-context MACTAB at $F80, `bad_macro`
on null vectors, vectors survive SPWN — all tested). Two findings:

**Null cost verified.** With MAC present but unused, the table above
reproduces exactly — the ring holds 66 cycles/pass. The mechanism's
existence costs nothing, as required.

**Corpus analysis says MAC cannot clear its bar here — recording the
arithmetic before any conversion.** The only sequence shared widely enough
to vector is the completion-status extract (`TYA`, 8×`LSR`, `AND #$FF`):
9 occurrences × 11 bytes = 99 bytes, replaceable by 9 one-byte `MAC`s plus
a ~13-byte shared routine ≈ **86 bytes saved, 3.6% of the 2412-byte
corpus** — under the 5% cut line, nowhere near the 20% adopt bar. The
real bulk is `##imm64` staging (9 bytes each), which no call mechanism
touches. Dynamically MAC is strictly negative here: +2 instructions and
+11 cycles per call site (JSR/RTS overhead), which would degrade the ring
headline to ~77 cycles/pass for a 10-byte saving.

**Verdict: deferred, prediction revised.** These programs are straight-line
protocol loops with one instance of each idiom — the corpus a MAC thrives
on (rich subroutine reuse) doesn't exist here yet. Re-measure after the
chain features land (AUTO_REPOST/LINK reshape every serve loop, changing
both numerator and denominator), and after any richer workload joins the
suite. If the picture holds, MAC parks as an optional implementation
feature per the sketch's middle band.
